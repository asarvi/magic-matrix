# magic-matrix
Implementing the magic matrix using VHDL. 
For generating a 5X5 matrix, you need 25 clocks. On each clock one number should be
generated. So within 25 clocks all numbers should be generated. For a 7X7 matrix, 49 clocks are
needed.
Inputs of the circuit
• Size of magic matrix. It should be an integer number
• Clock which is std_logic
• Reset signal which is std_logic
 Output of the circuit
• The matrix_out which is a std_logic_vector
